## Setup/Installation Requirements
To run this application you will need the following:
* A code editor. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is what I use.
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
### 1) Cloning the Project:
* Find the respository at (https://github.com/NickyLind/Tap-Room)
* Select the green <span style="color:green">'Code'</span> button above the repository and copy the HHTPS link
* In your terminal, find the directory you want to place the `Tap-Room` directory in
* In your terminal, use the git command `$git clone https://github.com/NickyLind/Beer-Me`
* Open in Visual Studio Code or another editor

### 2) Running the project:
* Navigate to the `Beer-Me` directory and build the project with the command `npm install` in the command line to install packages needed to run this project.
* Once the project packages are succesfully installed you may run the command `npm run start` and a browser should automatically be opened to http://localhost:3000/
